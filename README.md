This example shows off [Presence](https://docs.roomservice.dev/concepts/presence) in Room Service. You'll need to get an API Key for it to run. You can do that at [app.roomservice.dev](https://app.roomservice.dev/register).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
